-- LRA_tptp_ARI348_1, from SMT-LIB (LRA, status unsat).

-- (`--input_syntax smtlib2 --mode portfolio --schedule casc --cores 1 -t 1`).
--
-- The problem itself is `LRA_tptp_ARI348_1.smt2`, beside this file. An SMT problem is a
-- conjunction of assertions asked for satisfiability, so an `unsat` one becomes: take
-- the assertions as hypotheses, derive `False`. One hypothesis per `assert`, in order;
-- `let` is inlined, because neither this tactic nor a first-order prover has one.
--
-- Arithmetic is over ℚ.  The source is linear real arithmetic, and ℚ and ℝ are
-- elementarily equivalent for it -- both are dense ordered divisible abelian
-- groups and that theory is complete -- so `unsat` transfers from the `Real`
-- the problem is written over to the ℚ it is stated over here.
