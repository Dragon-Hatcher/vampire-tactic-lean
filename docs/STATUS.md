# Where this stands

Working notes for picking the work back up. See `README.md` for what the library is and
`vampire-global-state.md` for the audit that constrains the FFI.

## Layout

    lean-vampire/
      vampire/            our fork of vprover/vampire (upstream = vprover, branch
                          `avatar-resolution-replay`)
      vampire-tactic/     this package: the Lean tactic (branch `main`)
      bodingbauer-etall/  the paper's artifacts, left as reference
        vamplean/         upstream reconstruction lemmas, required by the tactic
        demo/             the leancheck demo and the lean-smt hammer prototype
        bench/            the Figure 2 benchmark harness

## Build

    cmake --build ../vampire/build --target vampire_lib   # 43MB static archive
    lake build                                            # tactic + tests

Lean 4.33.0 everywhere. `lake build` runs the tests as `#eval`s and fails on regression.

## What works

The whole loop, in process:

    theorem chained (α : Type) (f : α → α) (P : α → Prop) (a : α)
        (h₁ : ∀ x, P x → P (f x)) (h₂ : P a) : P (f (f a)) := by
      vampire
    -- 'chained' depends on axioms: [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]

**Goal translation** is a port of lean-smt's pipeline — the `@[vampire_translate]`
registry, the translation monad with its dependency tracking, the graph that orders
declarations, the preprocessing steps — retargeted from SMT-LIB text at an embedded
Vampire's own `Signature`/`Term`/`Literal`/`Formula`. Provenance in `NOTICE`.

**Proof translation** is a port of Vampire's own Lean code generator
(`Shell/LeanChecker`): one lemma per inference with the same statement, proved by the
same tactic script, chained the same way — as `Expr`s and tactic `Syntax` rather than
source text. This fork's changes to those scripts are included.

`vampire?` stops before the replay and shows the problem as Vampire renders it plus an
outline of the refutation.

## What does not

- **Polymorphism.** Vampire's logic is monomorphic; lean-smt's monomorphisation pass is
  not ported. A polymorphic hypothesis swept up from the context is skipped; one named
  as a hint is reported.
- **AVATAR.** Splitting, the SAT refutation, and this fork's resolution replay of it are
  not ported, so the tactic runs with `avatar off`. Biggest remaining piece.
- **Skolemisation and the definition introductions**, which bring symbols into the proof
  that the goal has no term for.
- **Multi-clause clausification**, `rectify` with a non-identity renaming, the
  quantifier reordering after prenexing, and arithmetic.
- `setSoftTimeLimit` bounds the saturation loop, not preprocessing or clausification.

## Things that will bite

Recorded because each cost real time to find.

1. **Lean elaborates tactics in parallel.** `Elab.async` is off by default but overridden
   on in the language server and cmdline. Measured: 7 threads, 3 concurrent. Every
   `extern "C"` function must open with `vampire_ffi::EntryGuard` from
   `ffi/vampire_lock.hpp`. A guard that only some entry points take is worse than none.
2. **Run-then-read is not atomic.** The lock makes each call atomic, not the sequence.
   The step buffers are `thread_local` for that reason.
3. **Lake does not track the Vampire archive.** It is declared as an input to
   `extern_lib`; without that a rebuilt Vampire leaves a stale dylib whose calls into new
   symbols fault with no stack.
4. **`env.proofExtra.get<>` segfaults on a missing entry** — no RTTI, no check. Guard
   with `find()`.
5. **Function-local statics that cache Vampire objects** dangle after a reset. Fixed for
   the built-in sorts; six more are listed in the audit, unhandled.
6. **The inference replayer leaked its saturation algorithm.** A `SaturationAlgorithm`
   registers itself and its indexes globally and unregisters only in its destructor, so
   the second problem solved in a process saturated without finding a proof it had
   found the first time. Invisible in a one-shot binary; fatal embedded. Fixed in the
   fork; the same shape is worth suspecting whenever run *n+1* behaves differently from
   run *n*.
7. **A `Unit*` does not survive preprocessing.** The problem's unit list is replaced by
   clausification, so anything the FFI wants to report about the input must be captured
   when it is built, not read back afterwards.
8. **Vampire generation is nondeterministic** under a wall-clock limit, so any
   before/after comparison must transform one fixed generated file, or sample enough to
   average out. This produced a phantom "2.6× regression" earlier in the work.

## Fork changes, in order

    2abf74e  AVATAR refutations as resolution steps, not bv_decide
    7032c0f  avoid `contradiction` over the whole context in clausification
    24f10e6  bind split propositions per theorem; autoImplicit false
    9126105  `vampire_lib` static target for embedding
    e3f62c2  `Lib::resetGlobalState` — more than one problem per process
    124034e  no exit(10); `Timer::startClock` so the timeout cannot _Exit the host
    9a593d8  re-arm the exit lock between runs
    e101aa7  do not leak the inference replayer's saturation algorithm

The first three are proof-generation work from before the FFI and are independent of
it: all 14 ALG problems that Vampire solves now check, 874s → 233s, four former
timeouts fixed. `bench/` reproduces that.

## Open questions

- Per-thread Vampire contexts would remove the global lock. Deferred deliberately.
- Whether to vendor `vamplean` rather than depend on a path into `bodingbauer-etall/`.
- The allocator is never reset, so a long-lived Lean process grows across runs.
